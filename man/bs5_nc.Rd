\title{gates out or assign indicators to BS5 cyano cells from a flowframe.}
\usage{
bs5_nc(bs4bs5, p1, p2, others, to_retain = "potential")
}
\arguments{
\item{bs4bs5}{flowframe with debris gated.}

\item{p1}{first flowcytometer channel that can be used to separate BS5 cells from the rest, e.g. "RED.B.HLin".}

\item{p2}{second flowcytometer channel that can be used to separate BS5 cells from the rest, e.g. "YEL.B.HLin"}

\item{others}{row numbers for non-debris events. This is provided by the debris_nc or debris_inc function.}

\item{retain}{should potential candidates be retained or further gating be applied to filter out only certain BS5 cells.}
}
