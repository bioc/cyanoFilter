\arguments{
\item{bs4bs5}{flowframe with.}

\item{p1}{first flowcytometer channel that can be used to separate BS4 cells from the rest, e.g. "RED.B.HLin".}

\item{others}{row numbers for non-debris events. This is provided by the debris_nc or debris_inc function.}

\item{retain}{should potential candidates be retained or further gating be applied to filter out only certain BS4 cells.}
