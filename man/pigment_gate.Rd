\description{
This function takes in a flowframe with debris removed and identifies
             phytoplankton cell population in the provided frame.
}
\details{
The function uses the \code{\link[flowDensity]{getPeaks}} and
         \code{\link[flowDensity]{deGate}} functions in the \emph{flowDensity} package to
<<<<<<< HEAD
         identify peaks and identify cut-off points between these peaks.
=======
         identify peaks and identify cut-off points between these peaks. This function is
         not designed to be called in isolation, if called in isolation an error will be
         returned. It is preferably called on the results from \code{\link{debris_nc}} or
         \code{\link{debris_inc}} function. A graph with horizontal
         and vertical lines used in separating the populations is returned and
         if \emph{to_retain = "refined"}, a circle made of dashed lines is drawn around
         phytoplankton cell population points.
