# Motivation and Background

Phytoplankton are primary producers responsible for about 50\% of global primary  production through photosynthesis. Studies seeking a better understanding of the ecology of phytoplankton have relied on flow cytometry (FCM) to measure phytoplankton abundance  and traits. FCM is a technique which involves the suspension of cells or particles within a fluid stream which is made to pass through one or more laser beams. A crucial step in FCM application is to separate signal from noise, a process termed gating. This process can be done manually, termed manual gating, or with the use of automated algorithms in  software packages, termed automated gating. Gating is typically done manually  or using model-based tools such as *flowClust* and *flowEMMi* or machine learning. While manual gating is often not fully reproducible, model-based tools and machine learning require tuning of global parameters that are not related to the biological properties of the measured cells and cannot readily integrate experts' knowledge. *cyanoFilter* for semi-automated gating of phytoplankton FCM data. The package uses pigment and complexity information to identify each phytoplankton population contained in a sample. Aside from identifying phytoplankton populations, *cyanoFilter* can also assist in the identification of previously unknown light channels useful for differentiating phytoplankton cells.

# Usage

The package comes with 2 internal datasets that we use for demonstrating the usage of the functions contained in the package. The **meta data** file contains *BS4* and *BS5* samples measured with a guava easyCyte HT series at 3 dilution levels (*2000*, *10000* and *20000*) each. The **FCS** file contains the flow cytometer channel measurements for one of these sample.

# Motivation and Background

Flow cytometry (FCM) is a well-known technique for identifying cell populations in fluids. It is largely applied in biological and medical sciences for cell sorting, counting, biomarker detections and protein engineering.  Identifying cell populations in flow cytometry data, a process termed gating can either be done mnually or via automated algorithms. Recenntly, researchers also apply machine learning tools to identify the different cell populations present in FCM data. Manual gating can be quite subjective and often not reproducible, but it aids the use of expert knowledge in the gating process, while machine learning tools and automated algorithms often don't allow the use of expert knowledge in the gating process. To address this issue for cyanobacteria FCM experiments, we develop the cyanoFilter framework in **R**. We also demonstrate its use in filtering out two cyanobacteria strains named BS4 and BS5.

## Meta File Preprocessing

### The Good Measurements 

<<<<<<< HEAD
The **goodfcs()** is deigned to check the $cell/\mu$L of the meta file (normally csv) obtained from the flow cytometer and decide if the measurements in the FCS file can be trusted. This function is especially useful for flow cytometers that are not equipped to perform automated dilution.

```{r the_csvs}
library(flowCore)
library(cyanoFilter)
#internally contained datafile in cyanoFilter
metadata <- system.file("extdata", "2019-03-25_Rstarted.csv", 
  package = "cyanoFilter", 
  mustWork = TRUE)
metafile <- read.csv(metadata, skip = 7, stringsAsFactors = FALSE, 
  check.names = TRUE)
#columns containing dilution, $\mu l$ and id information
metafile <- metafile[, c(1:3, 6:8)] 
knitr::kable(metafile) 
```

Each row in the csv file corresponds to a measurement from two types of cyanobacteria cells carried out at one of three dilution levels. The columns contain information about the dilution level, the number of cells per micro-litre ($cell/\mu l$), number of particles measured and a unique identification code for each measurement. The *Sample.ID* column is structured in the format cyanobacteria_dilution. We extract the cyanobacteria part of this column into a new column and also rename the $cell/\mu l$ column  with the following code:

<<<<<<< HEAD
```{r metafile1}
#extract the part of the Sample.ID that corresponds to BS4 or BS5
metafile <- metafile %>% dplyr::mutate(Sample.ID2 = 
                                         stringr::str_extract(metafile$Sample.ID, "BS*[4-5]")
                                       )
=======
```{r }
#extract the part of the Sample.ID that corresponds to BS4 or BS5
metafile$Sample.ID2 <- stringr::str_extract(metafile$Sample.ID, "BS*[4-5]")

#clean up the Cells.muL column
names(metafile)[which(stringr::str_detect(names(metafile), "Cells."))] <- "CellspML"
```

<<<<<<< HEAD
### Good Measurements

To determine the appropriate data file to read from a FCM datafile, the desired minimum, maximum and column containing the $cell\mu l$ values are supplied to the **goodfcs()** function. The code below demonstrates the use of this function for a situation where the desired minimum and maximum for $cell/\mu l$ is 50 and 1000 respectively.

```{r metafile2}
metafile <- metafile %>% mutate(Status = cyanoFilter::goodfcs(metafile = metafile, col_cpml = "CellspML", 
                                        mxd_cellpML = 1000, mnd_cellpML = 50)
                                )
=======
### The Good Measurements

The code below demonstrates the use of this function for a situation where the desired minimum and maximum for $cell/\mu l$ is 50 and 1000 respectively.

```{r}
metafile$Status <- cyanoFilter::goodfcs(metafile = metafile, col_cpml = "CellspML", 
                                        mxd_cellpML = 1000, mnd_cellpML = 50)

>>>>>>> 74ebbc1f0b57e1f0410570dfc73e0a04247a1d3a
knitr::kable(metafile)
```

The function adds an extra column, *Status*, with entries *good* or *bad* to the metafile. Rows containing $cell/\mu l$ values outside the desired minimum and maximum are labelled *bad*. Note that the *Status* column for the fourth row is labelled *bad*, because it has a $cell/\mu l$ value outside the desired range. 

### Files to Retain

Although any of the files labelled good can be read from the FCM file, the **retain()** function can help select either the file with the highest $cell/\mu l$ or that with the smallest $cell/\mu l$ value.  To do this, one supplies the function with the status column, $cell/\mu l$ column and the desired decision. The code below demonstrates this action for a case where we want to select the file with the maximum $cell/\mu l$ from the good measurements for each unique sample ID.

<<<<<<< HEAD
```{r metafile3}
=======
```{r metafile4}
>>>>>>> 74ebbc1f0b57e1f0410570dfc73e0a04247a1d3a
broken <- metafile %>% group_by(Sample.ID2) %>% nest()
metafile$Retained <- unlist(map(broken$data, function(.x) {
  retain(meta_files = .x, make_decision = "maxi",
  Status = "Status",
  CellspML = "CellspML")
 })
)
knitr::kable(metafile)
```

<<<<<<< HEAD
This function adds another column, *Retained*, to the metafile. The third and sixth row in the metadata are with the highest $cell/\mu l$ values, thus one can proceed to read the fourth and sixth file from the corresponding FCS file for *BS4* and *BS5* respectively. This implies that we are reading in only two FCS files rather than the six measured files.

## Flow Cytometer File Processing

To read **B4_18_1.fcs** file into **R**, we use the **read.FCS()** function from the **flowCore** package. The *dataset* option enables the specification of the precise file to be read. Since this datafile contains one file only, we set this option to 1. If this option is set to 2, it gives an error since **text.fcs** contains only one datafile.

flowfile <- read.FCS(flowfile_path, alter.names = TRUE,
  transformation = FALSE, emptyValue = FALSE,
  dataset = 1)
flowfile
```

The **R** object *flowfile* contains measurements about `r nrow(flowfile)` cells across `r ncol(flowfile) - 1` channels since the time channel does not contain any information about the properties of the measured cells.

### Transformation and visualisation

<<<<<<< HEAD
To examine the need for transformation, a visual representation of the information in the expression matrix is of great use. The **ggpairsDens()** function produces a panel plot of all measured channels. Each plot is also smoothed to show the cell density at every part of the plot.  

```{r remove_na, fig.cap="**Panel plot for all channels measured in flowfile_nona. A bivariate kernel smoothed color density is used to indicate the cell density.**"}
flowfile_nona <- nona(x = flowfile)
ggpairsDens(flowfile_nona, notToPlot = "TIME")
```

We obtain Figure  above by using the **ggpairsDens()** function after removing all `NA` values from the expression matrix with the **nona()** function. There is a version of the function, **pairs_plot()** that produces standard base scatter plots also smoothed to indicate cell density.

```{r logtrans, fig.cap="Panel plot for log-transformed channels for flowfile_logtrans. A bivariate kernel smoothed color density is used to indicate the cell density."}

```

The second figure is the result of performing a logarithmic transformation in addition to the previous actions taken. The logarithmic transformation appears satisfactory in this case, as it allow a better examination of the information contained in each panel of the figure. Moreover, the clusters are clearly visible in this figure compared to the former figure. Other possible  transformation (linear, bi-exponential and arcsinh) can be pursued if the logarithm transformation is not satisfactory. Functions for these transformations are provided in the **flowCore** package.

### Gating margin events

To remove margin events, the **cellmargin()** function takes the column in the expression matrix corresponding to measurements about the width of each cell. The code below demonstrates the removal of margin events using the SSC.W column with the option to estimate the cut point between the margin events and the good cells. 

<<<<<<< HEAD
```{r marginEvents, cache=TRUE, fig.cap="Smoothed Scatterplot of measured width (SSC.W) and height (FSC.HLin). The red line is the estimated cut point by flowDensity, and every particle below the red line has their width properly measured."}
flowfile_marginout <- cellmargin(flowframe = flowfile_logtrans,
                                 Channel = 'SSC.W', type = 'estimate', 
                                 y_toplot = "FSC.HLin")
plot(flowfile_marginout)

summary(flowfile_marginout, 
       channels = c('FSC.HLin', 'SSC.HLin', 
                    'SSC.W'))
```

*flowfile_marginout* is an S3 object of class `cyanoFilter` with **summary()** and **plot()** method. This object can be subsetted like a normal list. Running **plot()** on *flowfile_marginout* produces a plot of the width channel against the channel supplied in *y_toplot*. This action returns the figure \@ref(fig:marginEvents). flowfile_marginout contains the following sub-objects:
=======
```{r marginEvents, cache=TRUE, fig.cap="Smoothed Scatterplot of measured width (SSC.W) and height (FSC.HLin). The red line is the estimated cut point by flowDensity, and every particle below the red line has their width properly measured. This figure is produced automatically when users call the cellmargin() function."}
flowfile_marginout <- cellmargin(flow.frame = flowfile_logtrans,
  Channel = 'SSC.W', type = 'estimate', y_toplot = "FSC.HLin")
```

The function returns a figure (Figure \@ref(fig:marginEvents)) in this case) and a list containing:
>>>>>>> 74ebbc1f0b57e1f0410570dfc73e0a04247a1d3a

- *fullflowframe*, flowframe with indicator for margin and non-margin events in the expression matrix, 
- *reducedflowframe*, flowframe containing only non-margin events
- *N_margin*, number of margin events contained in the input flowframe
- *N_nonmargin*, number of non-margin events
- *N_particle*, number of particles in the input flowframe

<<<<<<< HEAD
Running **plot()** on *flowfile_marginout* gives you the number of margin and non-margin particles as well as descriptives on channels supplied. These descriptives are computed on the flowfile after the margin events have been removed.

### Gating Debris

To identify debris, we leverage on the presence of chlorophyll *a*

```{r Debris, fig.cap="Smoothed Scatterplot of measured chlorophyll *a* channel (RED.B.HLin) and phycoerythrin channel (YEL.B.HLin). The red lines are the estimated minimum intersection points between the detected peaks."}

cells_nodebris <-  debris_nc(flowframe = flowfile_marginout$reducedflowframe, 
                             ch_chlorophyll = "RED.B.HLin", ch_p2 = "YEL.B.HLin",
                             ph = 0.05)
plot(cells_nodebris)
```

### Gating cyanobacteria


We conceptualized the division of cells into clusters in two ways in cyanoFilter and this is reflected in two main functions that perform the clustering exercise; **phyto_filter()** and **celldebris_emclustering()**. The **phyto_filter()** function employs the following algorithm to separate particles into different clusters;

1. Search for peaks along the supplied pigment and cell complexity channels. 
2. Idneify the minimum intersection point between the peaks observed these channels.
2. Divide particles into groups based on the minimum intersection points identified in 1 and label each group.
3. Formulate all possible combinations of labels in step 2.
4. Assign a new label to the combinations in 3.
5. Retain clusters that make up a desired proportion of the total number of particles clustered.


```{r kdapproach, fig.cap="Smoothed Scatterplot of all channels used in the gating process."}

bs4_gate1 <- phyto_filter(flowfile = cells_nodebris$syn,
               pig_channels = c("RED.B.HLin", "YEL.B.HLin", "RED.R.HLin"),
               com_channels = c("FSC.HLin", "SSC.HLin"))

plot(bs4_gate1)
=======
The code below accesses the number of margin and non-margin particles. 

```{r }
flowfile_marginout$N_margin
flowfile_marginout$N_nonmargin
```


### Gating debris and cyanobacteria

We conceptualized the division of cells into clusters in two ways in cyanoFilter and this is reflected in two main functions that perform the clustering exercise; **celldebris_nc()** and **celldebris_emclustering()**. The **celldebris_nc()** function employs minimum intersection points between peaks observed in a two dimensional kernel density, while **celldebris_emclustering()** employs a finite mixture of multivariate normals to assign probability of belonging to a cluster to each measured particle. Both functions produce plots by default to enable users examine the results of the clustering. 

After removing margin events, it is of interest to identify BS4 cyanobacteria cells contained in the **text.fcs** datafile that we have pre-processed until now. The following code separates BS4 cyanobacteria cells using the two channels measuring the presence of chlorophyll *a*, RED.B.HLin, and phycoerythrin, YEL.B.HLin. We use the knowledge of knowing that the BS4 cells will be on the right part of the RED.B.HLin channel because of the presence of chlorophyll *a*, and also on the lower part of the YEL.B.HLin channel due to low presence of phycoerythrin.


```{r kdapproach, fig.cap="Smoothed Scatterplot of measured chlorophyll *a* channel (RED.B.HLin) and phycoerythrin channel (YEL.B.HLin). The red lines are the estimated minimum intersection points between the detected peaks. Particles to the left of the vertical red line are debris with no chlorophyll *a*, and those below the horizontal red line have low values of phycoerythrin. The plot is produced automatically when users call the celldebris_nc() function."}

bs4_gate1 <- celldebris_nc(flowfile_marginout$reducedflowframe, 
  channel1 = "RED.B.HLin", channel2 = "YEL.B.HLin", 
  interest = "bottom-right", to_retain = "refined" )
>>>>>>> 74ebbc1f0b57e1f0410570dfc73e0a04247a1d3a
```

The resulting object is a figure (Figure \@ref(fig:kdapproach)) and a list containing the following: 

- *reducedframe*, a flowFrame with all debris removed 
- *fullframe*, flowFrame with all measured particles and indicator for debris and cyanobacteria cells 
- *Cell_count*, the number of BS4 cells counted 
- *Debris_Count*, the number of debris particles. 

An alternative function for identifying BS4 cells is the **celldebris_emclustering()** function. This function tries to identify the number of clusters supplied via the *ncluster* option, but this number is reduced if there are clusters with no particles during the EM iterations. The function can also accept more than two channels as input. The code below demonstrates its use with four channels measuring chlorophyll *a*, phycoerythrin, height and phycocyanin respectively.


<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
```{r emapproach, cache=TRUE, fig.cap="Smoothed scatterplot of all channels used for gating. The plot is generated by assigning points to each cluster if their probability of belonging to that cluster is atleast 80%, which is set by the classifier option. Each cluster is assigned a colour, and  bivariate kernel smoothed color density is used to indicate the cell density. The boundaries of the cluster with the highest number of particles is drawn."}

bs4_gate2 <- celldebris_emclustering(flowfile_marginout$reducedflowframe, 
  channels =  c("RED.B.HLin", "YEL.B.HLin", "FSC.HLin", "RED.R.HLin"), 
  ncluster = 3, min.itera = 20, classifier = 0.8)
```

The resulting object is a figure (Figure \@ref(fig:emapproach)) and a list containing the following: 

i) *percentages* the final weight for each cluster 
ii) *mus*, matrix of means for each channel per cluster 
iii) *sigmas*, list containing variance-covariace matrices for each cluster, 
iv) *result*, flowfile with an expression matrix containing all the measured particles and the associated probability of each particle belonging to a cluster. 

Users can examine the means or cluster weights to determine which cluster is of interest, and then filter out particles belonging to that cluster with a certain minimum probability. For example, we demonstrate an example below by filtering out particles belonging to the cluster with the highest weight by at least 80%.

```{r filtering}
max_cluster_weight <- which(bs4_gate2$percentages == 
  max(bs4_gate2$percentages))
cluster_name <- paste("Cluster", "Prob", 
  max_cluster_weight, sep = "_")
reduced_frame <- which(bs4_gate2$result[, cluster_name] >= 0.80)
```

The object *reduced_frame* is a flowframe containing all particles belonging to the largest cluster with probability of at least 80%. Following the same steps or knowledge of these cells, users can filter out particles belonging to certain clusters with characteristics of interest to them.

### Gating Debris and cyanobacteria in biculture

The second file used for demonstration contains both BS4 and BS5 cyanobacteria cells.

```{r reading2, cache=TRUE}
flowfile2_path <- system.file("extdata", "B4_B5_18_1.fcs", package = "cyanoFilter",
  mustWork = TRUE)
flowfile2 <- read.FCS(flowfile2_path, alter.names = TRUE,
  transformation = FALSE, emptyValue = FALSE,
  dataset = 1)
flowfile2
```

All the steps previously demonstrated remains unchanged, s we carry it all out in one huge code chunk.

```{r remove_na2, cache=TRUE}
flowfile_nona2 <- nona(x = flowfile2)
pair_plot(flowfile_nona2, notToPlot = "TIME")

#natural logarithm transformation
flowfile_noneg2 <- noneg(x = flowfile_nona2)
flowfile_logtrans2 <- lnTrans(x = flowfile_noneg2, 
  notToTransform = c("SSC.W", "TIME"))
pair_plot(flowfile_logtrans2, notToPlot = "TIME")

#gating margin events
flowfile_marginout2 <- cellmargin(flow.frame = flowfile_logtrans2,
  Channel = 'SSC.W', type = 'estimate', y_toplot = "FSC.HLin")
```


Again we use the two channels measuring cholorophyll *a* and phycoerythrin, but we set the **interest** option to *both-right*. This means that we are expecting the cyanobacteria cells to be on the right of channel 1.

```{r gating3}
bs45_gate1 <- celldebris_nc(flowfile_marginout2$reducedflowframe, 
  channel1 = "RED.B.HLin", channel2 = "YEL.B.HLin", 
  interest = "both-right", to_retain = "refined" )
```

For the *EM* clustering approach, nothing changes as well. However, users must analyse the result of the clustering to determine which cluster is of interest.

```{r gating4}
bs4_gate2 <- celldebris_emclustering(flowfile_marginout$reducedflowframe, 
  channels =  c("RED.B.HLin", "YEL.B.HLin", "FSC.HLin", "RED.R.HLin"), 
  ncluster = 4, min.itera = 20, classifier = 0.8)
```
