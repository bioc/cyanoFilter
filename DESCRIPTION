Description: It filters out living cyano cells from all particles measured via flowcytometry. 
    It combines known characteristics of BS4 and BS5 cyanobacteria alongside flowDensity package to 
    maximally filter out BS4 and BS5 cyano cells from debris and doublets. However, it can also be used for
    cyanobacteria cells that are differentaible in two dimensions.
