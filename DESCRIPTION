Description: An approach to filter out and/or identify phytoplankton cells from 
    all particles measured via flow cytometry pigment and cell complexity 
    information. It does this using a sequence of one-dimensional gates on 
    pre-defined channels measuring certain pigmentation and complexity. The package is especially
    tuned for cyanobacteria, but will work fine for phytoplankton communities where there is at least
    one cell characteristic that differentiates every phytoplankton in the community.
